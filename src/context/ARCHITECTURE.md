# System Architecture

## Application Structure

The portfolio is built as a single-page application (SPA) with a component-based architecture. 

### Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Base UI components (shadcn)
│   └── ...             # Custom components
├── context/            # Documentation and context providers
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                # Utility functions and data
├── pages/              # Page components
├── sections/           # Major page sections
└── assets/             # Static assets
```

## State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management solutions:

- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state (useState)
- **Context API**: For sharing state across components when needed
- **React Query**: For any external data fetching requirements

## Routing

React Router handles client-side routing with the following structure:

- `/` - Home page with all sections
- `/projects/:id` - Individual project details
- `*` - 404 page for handling invalid routes

## Component Hierarchy

## Performance Considerations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading components when appropriate
2. **Asset Optimization**: Optimized images and SVGs
3. **Memoization**: Using React.memo for expensive render operations
4. **Animation Performance**: Using GPU-accelerated properties for animations
5. **Efficient Rendering**: Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with proper state management
