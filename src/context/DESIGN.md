## Color Palette

The application uses a carefully selected color palette that balances professionalism with creativity:

- **Primary**: Blue hue (#4361EE) - Represents professionalism and reliability
- **Accent**: Purple hue (#B721FF) - Adds a creative touch and visual interest
- **Background**: Dark blue-black gradient - Creates depth and focuses attention on content
- **Text**: Light colors with varying opacity for hierarchy
- **Cards/UI Elements**: Subtle transparent backgrounds with blur effects

## Typography

The application uses a single cohesive font family for better consistency:

- **Main Font**: Space Grotesk - A modern sans-serif with geometric forms
- **Heading Sizes**:
  - Main headings: 2.5rem (40px)
  - Section headings: 2rem (32px)
  - Subsection headings: 1.5rem (24px)
- **Body Text**: 1rem (16px) with 1.5 line height for optimal readability
- **Font Weights**:
  - Bold (700) for headings
  - Medium (500) for subheadings
  - Regular (400) for body text

## Layout System

The layout uses a combination of:

- Responsive grid system for main layout structure
- Flexbox for component-level alignments
- CSS Grid for more complex grid arrangements
- Container with max-width constraints for content alignment
- Consistent spacing scales for margins and padding

## UI Components

The application includes the following carefully crafted UI components:

- **Cards**: With subtle hover effects and shadows
- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, and outline variants
- **Progress Bars**: Interactive with animation
- **Navigation**: Responsive with mobile adaptation
- **Collapsible Sections**: For better information organization
- **Badges/Tags**: To categorize projects and skills
- **Icons**: Used consistently to enhance visual communication

## Animation Guidelines

Animations follow these principles:

1. **Subtlety**: Animations should enhance, not distract
2. **Purpose**: Each animation serves a functional purpose
3. **Timing**: Quick enough to feel responsive (200-500ms)
4. **Easing**: Natural easing functions for organic feel
5. **Consistency**: Similar elements animate in similar ways

Common animations include:
- Fade-in on scroll/page load
- Hover state transitions
- Expansion/collapse of sections
- Progress bar fills
- Subtle floating/breathing effects for certain UI elements
