# Design Documentation

## Color Palette

The application uses a dark luxurious theme with gold and purple accents:

- **Primary**: Gold hue (#D4AF37) - Represents luxury and premium feel
- **Accent**: Purple hue (#8B5CF6) - Adds a creative touch and visual interest
- **Background**: Deep dark blue-black gradient (#0A0914) - Creates depth with subtle purple radial gradients
- **Text**: Light golden tones with varying opacity for hierarchy
- **Cards/UI Elements**: Dark backgrounds with gold border accents and glow effects

## Typography

The application uses a single cohesive font family for better consistency:

- **Main Font**: Space Grotesk - A modern sans-serif with geometric forms
- **Heading Sizes**:
  - Main headings: 2.5rem (40px)
  - Section headings: 2rem (32px)
  - Subsection headings: 1.5rem (24px)
- **Body Text**: 1rem (16px) with 1.5 line height for optimal readability
- **Font Weights**:
  - Bold (700) for headings
  - Medium (500) for subheadings
  - Regular (400) for body text

## Design Effects

The application uses several visual effects to enhance the luxury feel:

- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle purple and gold gradients that shift with scroll and mouse movement
- **Glassmorphism**: Transparent glass-like effects on cards and UI elements
- **Gold Glows**: Subtle golden glows on interactive elements
- **Grid Overlay**: Subtle grid pattern that fades with scroll
- **Moving Particles**: Small animated dots in the background
- **Text Effects**: Gradient and shimmer effects on important text
- **Animated Lines**: Subtle animated gold and purple lines in the background

## Layout System

The layout uses a combination of:

- Responsive grid system for main layout structure
- Flexbox for component-level alignments
- CSS Grid for more complex grid arrangements
- Container with max-width constraints for content alignment
- Consistent spacing scales for margins and padding

## UI Components

The application includes the following carefully crafted UI components:

- **Cards**: With subtle gold glow effects and dark backgrounds
- **Buttons**: Gold gradient primary, dark outline secondary variants
- **Progress Bars**: Interactive with animation and purple/gold gradients
- **Navigation**: Responsive with mobile adaptation
- **Collapsible Sections**: For better information organization
- **Badges/Tags**: Gold accented to categorize projects and skills
- **Icons**: Used consistently with subtle glow effects

## Animation Guidelines

Animations follow these principles:

1. **Subtlety**: Animations should enhance, not distract
2. **Purpose**: Each animation serves a functional purpose
3. **Timing**: Quick enough to feel responsive (200-500ms)
4. **Easing**: Natural easing functions for organic feel
5. **Consistency**: Similar elements animate in similar ways

Common animations include:
- Fade-in on scroll/page load
- Gold glow hover states
- Expansion/collapse of sections
- Progress bar fills with gradient animations
- Subtle floating/breathing effects for certain UI elements
- Background elements that react to user scroll and mouse movement
