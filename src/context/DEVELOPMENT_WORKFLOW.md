# Development Workflow

## Project Setup

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript
   - Add essential dependencies (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion)
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality

2. **Design System Setup**:
   - Define color scheme variables in the CSS
   - Configure typography scales
   - Set up base components

## Development Process

Our development process followed these steps:

1. **Planning and Requirements**:
   - Define target audience and objectives
   - Create list of required sections and features
   - Establish content requirements

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Create mockups for desktop and mobile layouts
   - Develop component designs
   - Define animation and interaction patterns

3. **Implementation**:
   - Set up project structure and routing
   - Build core UI components
   - Implement major page sections
   - Add animations and interactions
   - Make responsive adjustments
   - Optimize performance

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Responsive design testing
   - Performance testing
   - Accessibility testing
   - Content review and refinement

5. **Deployment**:
   - Configure build process
   - Set up hosting and deployment
   - Implement analytics (if needed)

## Best Practices

Throughout development, we adhere to these best practices:

1. **Component Architecture**:
   - Create small, focused components
   - Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Follow the single responsibility principle

2. **State Management**:
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Lift state only when necessary
   - Use appropriate hooks for different use cases

3. **Performance**:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Use memoization where appropriate

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Use semantic HTML
   - Implement proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Test on various device sizes
   - Use responsive utility classes

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Consistent code formatting
   - Meaningful comments
   - Clear naming conventions
   - TypeScript for type safety
