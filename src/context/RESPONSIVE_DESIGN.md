# Responsive Design

## Approach

The portfolio uses a mobile-first approach to responsive design, ensuring great experiences across all device sizes:

1. **Mobile-First Development**: Base styles are written for mobile, then progressively enhanced for larger screens
2. **Fluid Typography**: Font sizes that scale smoothly between viewport widths
3. **Flexible Layouts**: Using percentage-based widths and CSS Grid/Flexbox
4. **Targeted Breakpoints**: Strategic media queries based on content needs, not specific devices
5. **Content Prioritization**: Critical content is prioritized on smaller screens

## Breakpoint System

The application uses these primary breakpoints:

```css
/* Small (mobile) - Base styles, no media query */

/* Medium (tablets) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet styles */
}

/* Large (laptops) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Laptop styles */
}

/* Extra Large (desktops) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  /* Desktop styles */
}
```

## Responsive Patterns

### Navigation
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-in drawer
- Desktop: Horizontal navigation bar with dropdowns

### Layout
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: Two-column layout for some sections
- Desktop: Multi-column layout with increased whitespace

### Typography
- Base font size: 16px
- Scale ratio: 1.2 (minor third)
- Fluid headings using clamp():
  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw + 1rem, 3.5rem);
  }
  ```

### Images
- Responsive sizing with max-width: 100%
- Different image resolutions loaded based on viewport size
- Lazy loading for images below the fold

### UI Components
- Cards stack vertically on mobile, grid on desktop
- Tabs convert to accordion on mobile
- Tables become cards on mobile
- Side-by-side layouts become stacked on mobile

## Testing Strategy

Responsive design is verified through:

1. **Device Testing**: Testing on actual physical devices
2. **Browser Tools**: Using browser responsive design tools
3. **Automated Testing**: Visual regression testing across breakpoints
4. **Usability Testing**: Testing user interactions at different screen sizes

## Accessibility Considerations

Responsive design includes accessibility features:

1. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements
2. **Zoom Support**: All content remains functional at 200% zoom
3. **Orientation Support**: Content works in both portrait and landscape
4. **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion
5. **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators across all screen sizes
